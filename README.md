# Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS) - NSCC  
## Capstone Project: Leveraging GIS for Wildfire Applications in the WUI

### üî• Overview  
**Leveraging GIS for Wildfire Applications in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)**

This project explores how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to assess wildfire hazard levels in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) zones‚Äîareas where human development meets wildland vegetation. Focused on a section of Halifax Regional Municipality, the project integrates topography, fuel type, and weather data to model fire hazard levels using both **ArcGIS Pro** and **Google Earth Engine**.

These scripts were developed as a requirement for the Graduate Certificate in GIS at the Centre of Geographic Sciences, NSCC, Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia.

For educational purposes only. Created by Brian Gauthier ¬© 2025 COGS.

### üß© Core Components Implemented

- **Topographic Risk Mapping**  
  DEM-derived slope, aspect, and elevation maps were created and classified using LiDAR data to improve accuracy.

- **Fuel Type Classification**  
  Sentinel-2 imagery was used to classify vegetation using NDVI/EVI, providing a fuel hazard layer integrated into ArcGIS Pro.

- **Weather-Based Hazard Layer**  
  Historical seasonal weather data (temperature, wind, humidity, precipitation) was used to calculate a fire danger index layer.

---

### üìì Notebooks Included  
Each notebook walks through part of the data processing and analysis pipeline, from preprocessing DEMs and remote sensing data to classifying fuel types and integrating multi-layer hazard maps.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

Due to time constraints, the **real-time weather API integration** and **evacuation route planning** features were not implemented. However, the scripts and methods included are modular and designed to support future integration of these components.

---

### üéØ Goal

To provide a flexible hazard mapping framework that can be adapted to other Canadian regions using new data sources, enabling improved fire prevention planning, risk communication, and future automation for emergency response.

## 7. `wildfire_totHazard.ipynb`

**Weighted Fire Hazard Index calculation by combining fuel, terrain, and weather raster data with normalization and reclassification using ArcPy**

This script computes seasonal fire hazard indices by integrating fuel load, terrain difficulty, and weather condition rasters. It normalizes input rasters to a consistent 1‚Äì5 scale, calculates a weighted sum hazard index, then reclassifies the output into four discrete hazard classes for spring, summer, and fall.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Tasks Performed:

  - Checks out the Spatial Analyst extension for raster operations.
  
- **Normalization:**
  - Defines a function `normalize_raster` to scale raster values linearly to a 1‚Äì5 range.
  - Applies normalization to weather rasters and adjusts fuel raster values (originally 0‚Äì4) by adding 1 to align with 1‚Äì5 scale.
  - Terrain raster assumed pre-scaled (1‚Äì5), so no normalization applied.

- **Hazard Index Calculation:**
  - Loads fuel, terrain, and seasonal weather rasters.
  - Combines normalized rasters into a weighted sum hazard raster with weights:
    - Fuel: 0.4
    - Terrain: 0.3
    - Weather: 0.3
  - Saves weighted hazard raster for each season (spring, summer, fall).

- **Reclassification:**
  - Defines a 4-class reclassification scheme mapping continuous hazard values into integer hazard classes 1 to 4.

### üìù Notes:

- Terrain raster values are expected in the 1‚Äì5 scale, representing terrain difficulty or susceptibility.  
- Weather raster values normalized dynamically to 1‚Äì5 using raster min/max.  
- Reclassification bins hazard values into four classes for simplified hazard interpretation.  
- Modular functions support flexibility to adjust weights or reclassification scheme.
